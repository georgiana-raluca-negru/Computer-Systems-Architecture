# Minimal OS Storage Management Project

## 📄 Description
This project involves developing a Storage Device Management component for a minimal operating system (OS), which is fundamentally responsible for coordinating computing activities and mediating resource access for applications.
 
The implementation must account for two distinct operational modes: one based on linear **(unidimensional)** memory and one based on **two-dimensional** memory.
